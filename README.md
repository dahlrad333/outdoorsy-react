## things I would do if I had another few days
 - make a custom pagination component 
 - improve the style of the pagination element (padding between pages and nav buttons)
 - prevent an autofill value from appearing in the pagination limit
 - put pagination at bottom of page
 - put a timeout on the fetchData that will only send the request after the user has stopped typing for 1 second
 - add loading indicator to individual images
 - add loading indicator to the list of results as we get them
